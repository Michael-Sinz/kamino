# Greetings from Thomas Richter (Amiga/MuForce/Enforcer)

Excuse me if I'm trying to contact you in this unorthodox way, but
apparently your email enforcer@sinz.org seems to be no longer working,
and I haven't found another way of contacting you.

Greetings from Germany, hope all is well. If you recall, you were kind
enough (almost 20 years from now) to allow me to update your valuable
"Enforcer" tool to use the mmu.library, and thus to become
"MuForce". As such, it is still the most-used debugging tool on the
68K based Amigas - of course still on a hobby basis.

Now a question - I see that you also provide sources for SegTracker on
your home page. Would it be possible for me to update SegTracker as
well? My current plans are to fix a couple of minor issues (also track
non-ROM modules) and also track modules loaded by "LoadModule", a
generic kickstart module replacement tool that became the standard
tool for updating the kickstart without requiring a new ROM.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks, stay healthy, and all the best,

Thomas Richter

PS: It would be great if you could come back to me on the above
question. Note that the email address changed, the old
thor@math.tu-berlin.de is no longer valid, but alternatively, you can
use thomas.richter@alumni.tu-berlin.de.

If you don't want to respond - this is ok, too.
